The idea with this file is that 
1) I have no idea how to actually measure the complexity of an operation
2) So, the way I should figure this out is by coming up with as many features of the incomming numbers
   and then try to match those features to the number of seconds it takes me to actually perform the move
   using a VERY basic ml thing
